      "An interpreted language is a type of programming language where the source code is executed line by line by an interpreter at runtime. The interpreter reads the code, converts it into machine code, and then executes it immediately. This allows for easier debugging and greater flexibility, as changes to the code can be made on the fly.\n",

      "On the other hand, a compiled language is a type of programming language where the source code is translated into machine code before being executed. The compiler converts the entire source code into an executable file, which is then run on the computer. This typically results in faster and more efficient code execution, as the machine code is optimized for the specific hardware it will run on.\n",
